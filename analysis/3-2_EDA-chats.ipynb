      "Thanks for sharing that! It sounds like a mix of being tired and juggling a lot at once can lead to those moments of forgetfulness for you. Can you think of a specific time when being busy made you forget your purpose in a room? What was going on around you that day?\n",
      "Yeah. I remember I was doing a lot of projects around the house,I was also busy on my phone speaking to people. And I went from one room to another room. I've doneafter the right tools I needed. So, yeah, that was definitely specific to what happened.\n",
      "That sounds like a classic case of multitasking! It can be really easy to lose track when you're pulled in so many directions.

      "First and foremost, I'll make sure I'm not on my phone.And then, also, I remind myself, do you know what I mean? You're in conversation with someone now, like, pay attention. Don'tallow your mind to zone off. So, again, it's a bit of mindfulness.\n",
      "That sounds like a solid approach! It’s great that you’re using mindfulness to stay present in conversations. How do you find that practicing this mindfulness affects your interactions with others? Do you notice any changes in how you connect with them?\n",
      "Yeah. Definitely. I'll say it's, certainly very beneficial.For everyone to have a bit of mindfulness.This can help us adopt a pro an approach where wegrow as people, where we have a bit of accountability and think before we act.\n",
      "Absolutely, that’s such a thoughtful perspective! It sounds like you see mindfulness as a way not just to enhance your own experiences but also to foster growth and accountability in relationships. Can you think of a specific moment where practicing mindfulness helped you navigate a tricky conversation or situation?\n",
      "Yeah. I think a good example is when I had toto tell an employee, but he had to change, his approach to work, and Iattitude as he'd no longer have his job. So I had to havegreat mindfulness so I didn't allow myself to get emotionallydriven.\n",
      "That's a tough situation, and it sounds like you handled it with a lot of care. It’s impressive that you were able to stay mindful and not let emotions take over during such a challenging conversation. How did you prepare yourself mentally for that discussion? Did you have any specific strategies in place to keep the focus on the message you needed to convey?\n",

      "Some people prefer to keep things in the same spot, while others leave them wherever they last used them. What approach works best for you, and why do you think that is?\n",
      "I tend toleave things where I last used them.Because that would be the last association that my brain has with the object.\n",
      "That makes a lot of sense! It sounds like you have a thoughtful method for keeping track of things by linking them to your last memory of use. How do you feel about this approach? Do you find it works well for you most of the time, or do you ever wish you had a different system?\n",
      "It tends to work well for me.But occasionally, I stillstruggle.To find some objects.\n",
      "It's great to hear that your approach generally works! It sounds like you have a solid system in place, even if it doesn't always hit the mark. When you do struggle to find something, how do you typically go about retracing your steps or looking for those lost objects?\n",
      "I would have to think about everything that I've done.Every kind of place in the house that I've been to, and then I'd go to every room.\n",
      "That sounds like a thorough way to track down what you're looking for! It must take a bit of time to mentally retrace your steps like that. Do you find that this process helps jog your memory, or does it sometimes make you feel more frustrated?\n",

      "It sounds like long listening sessions, like lectures, can sometimes lead your mind to wander a bit. What do you think typically triggers that daydreaming for you? Is it the content, the length of the lecture, or maybe something else?\n",
      "I think it's more to do with my brain becoming fatigued.Due to the length of the lecture rather than necessarily the content.\n",
      "That makes a lot of sense! It’s interesting how mental fatigue can play such a big role in our ability to stay focused. When you start feeling that fatigue set in, do you have any strategies or techniques you use to refocus or recharge during those longer sessions?\n",
      "I sometimes try to get engaged in tasks on my laptop.That aren't related to the lecture justto stimulate it, to become more conscious.\n",
      "That's a clever approach! Engaging with tasks on your laptop can definitely help shake off that fatigue. Do you find that certain types of tasks work better for you than others in keeping your mind alert?\n",

Sometimes I'll alwayshave to double check I've locked the front door or when I'm leaving workIf I'm solo work and I'm the only one, I have tolike, do a little ritual of making like, testing the handle to make sure it's locked.Before I go to work, I'll, like, literally be ready to leave my front doorLike, I will have checked everything already, but I'll go back through the house in a particular order.Check the bathroom light. Check my straighteners are unplugged. Check thethe bedroom light. Check the living room's okay.Check the kitchen, and then I'll leave. And that little order just kind of solidifies in my mind.I've gone around. I've done everything. I'm ready to leave.\n",
      "That sounds like quite the thorough routine! It’s interesting how our minds create these little rituals to help us feel secure. How did you come up with that specific order for checking things? Does it give you a sense of calm or reassurance when you follow it?\n",
      "I think it started so when I first moved into this flat because I was kind ofnot familiar with the surroundings, I'd, like, go to leave and checkthis, then run to the door, then go back and kind of you know, it would be very backwards and forwards.And I think just over time, it's developed that I kind of, like,mimic the way that the flat is laid out to be able to leave the door.\n",
      "That makes a lot of sense! It’s amazing how our environment can shape our habits and routines. It sounds like creating that order helped you feel more at home and in control when you first moved in. Do you find that this routine helps ease any anxiety you might feel about leaving, or has it evolved into just a comforting habit now?\n",
      "I think it's more of ahabit. I am quite a forgetful person. Not forgetful. II'm a kind of person that gets a bit flusteredand I'm too focused on one thing that I'll kind of forget about the 50 otherthings that are maybe a bit more important because I'm just kind of a bit like, go, go, go.So this just kind of, like, tells my brain, you're ready to leave. You're okay. Younot forgotten anything. Go.\n",
      "That sounds really insightful! It seems like your routine acts as a mental check-in, helping you ground yourself amidst all the busyness. It's great that you've found a system that works for you! When you’re feeling flustered, do you have any other strategies or practices that help you refocus or calm your mind?\n",

      "It sounds like you've found that keeping things in their designated spots works better for you, but you still find yourself leaving them wherever you last used them. That’s totally relatable! What do you think makes it challenging to stick to your preferred method of organization?\n",
      "I think sometimes I just move on to thething so quickly that I kind of forget to tidy up the thing I'm doing. For example,if I'm reading a book and I leave my book on the table rather than where it's supposed to be nextto my bed, I will then move on to the nextthing and then completely forgetthat I was doing that task beforehand because I kind of get so engrossed in the next thing.\n",
      "That makes a lot of sense! It sounds like when you get caught up in your activities, it’s easy to lose track of where things should go. Do you find that certain activities or tasks make you more engrossed than others? And how do you usually feel when you realize something is out of place?\n",
      "I often get engrossed in taskslike anything creative. I'm quite a creative minded person, soanything like painting, drawing, reading, that sort of stuff will embraceme more than, say, like, going to my phone and things like that.And I forgot the second half of the question.\n",
      "Got it! Creative tasks definitely have a way of pulling us in and making time fly. When you realize something is out of place after getting lost in those activities, how does that make you feel? Does it frustrate you, or do you find it more amusing?\n",

      "I think it happens mostly in a work setting, but I think it canit can show people that you are, like, invested in building a connectwith them if you stop what you're doing to give somebody else your full attention.You're, like, interested. You're intrigued. You wanna hear what they wanna date they're saying. Like, you wannagive your opinion back. I think it's a sign of, like,it's it's respectful to people. It shows it, like, you actually care about what they're saying, and you want to hear what they'resaying.\n",
      "Absolutely, that's such a wonderful perspective! It really does show respect and interest in others when you take the time to listen. It sounds like you value those connections and want to create a positive atmosphere at work. Have you noticed any particular moments where stopping to listen made a big difference in your interactions with colleagues or friends?\n",
      "There's a lady at work called Teresa. She's one of the volunteers I work with.She's in her mid seventies. She's a really lovely person.And on Wednesday, I was in charge, and I spent a lot of time talking to her.And me sitting therehaving a conversation with herit could have been, like, a one minute conversation. Do you want a cupof tea? But because I sat and talked to her and was offering my opinions back,and we were having a right laugh about things, she really opened upto me about some quite personal things, and it made me understand her better as a person, butmade me understand why the volunteering is so important to her.It gave me an insight into her personality. And I think we really bondedkind of our relationship, and it was nice to have that moment of uskind of opening up to each other and talking very candidly to each other.\n",
      "That's such a beautiful example of how meaningful conversations can really deepen connections! It sounds like you created a safe space for Teresa to share more about herself, which not only helped you understand her better but also strengthened your bond. Moments like that can be so enriching.

Maybe it's more when I'm doing something outside of the norm of going into thatroom. And I think sometimes I'm just thinking aboutso many other things or, you know, just distracted by something elsethat'll completely forget what I'm doing.\n",
      "That makes a lot of sense! It sounds like your mind is juggling a lot of thoughts when you're moving around, which can definitely lead to those moments of forgetfulness. Can you think of any specific distractions that tend to pull your focus when you're in those situations?\n",
      "I think it's more just when I havea lot on my mind, I'm distracted.By myself.Rather than by, like, a phone orsomething like that.\n",
      "Got it! So it’s more about the mental clutter than external distractions. When you have a lot on your mind, do you find it helps to take a moment to clear your thoughts, or do you just roll with it and see where your brain takes you?\n",
      "Quite often, I'llroll with it, but it kind of depends on the situation and the amount ofstuff I'm juggling. For so for example, if I'm at work and I've got lots of tasksto do, I'll write a to do list because in my workplace, there's always a lot of distractions.Like new things adding to the list and, like, people that you have to talk to and interact with.So lists definitely helped me. And when I'mhome, if it's if it's, like, quite bad and there's a lot of things I'mjuggling, and some of them are, like, emotional things, I'll journal as well that helpsget my thoughts in order and kind of bring me back down.\n",
      "That sounds like a solid approach! Using to-do lists at work to manage distractions is a great strategy, and journaling at home for those emotional moments seems really therapeutic. How do you feel after you've written things down? Does it change your perspective on what you're juggling?\n",

And the way he makesyou feel sympathy for the main character who is a monsterthen there's a couple of other books I love because they made me laughactually laugh out loud. So there's a confederacy ofduncesand, lucky Jim.Very, very different.Works, but they both sort of celebrate theabsurdity of bothindividuals and life in general. Very funny.\n",

And,there's a quote I've heard attributed to different people. It's something like, lifeis a tragedy in close-up.But a comedy at a distance. And I think that really explainsa lot of what I'm feeling. So even when something isbeen horrible for me going horribly wrong,I usually try and find something in it that either isgood orthat might make me laugh.Or something that's been good about my day.

      "Can you recall any situations when your purpose for being in a room skipped your mind? Do you have any explanation for why it happened?\n",
      "Well, it's been happening to us a lot recently, but I've been under a great deal of stress.I think that's probably got a lot to do with\n",
      "It sounds like stress might be playing a significant role in those moments of forgetfulness. Can you share a bit more about what's been stressing you out lately?\n",
      "Recently, about three weeks ago, lost apet cat.She was 16, andI really upset her, and it took a while to get over it.\n",
      "I'm really sorry to hear about your cat. Losing a pet can be incredibly tough, especially after so many years together. It makes sense that such a big loss would contribute to feeling stressed and forgetful. How have you been coping since then?\n",
      "Not very well.But I'm getting through it. I've went and got myself two kittens, which I've added to the stress, butthat fun I have around as well.\n",
      "It's great to hear that you've brought two kittens into your life! They can definitely bring joy and a bit of playful chaos. How are you finding the balance between the added stress and the fun they bring?\n",
      "--- It is more enjoyable than it is stressful\n",
      "-------------------\n",
      "Remembering names can be effortless for some and tricky for others. Are there people whose names you find easier or harder to remember?\n",
      "It's normally when I'm first introduced to somebody.Then they'll I'll be told that I am, and it just pops straight back out of my head.\n",
      "That's really interesting! It sounds like the initial introductions can be a bit of a blur for you. Do you notice any particular situations or environments where remembering names is especially challenging, like at work or social gatherings?\n",
      "I find social gatherings very stressful. So when I'mintroduced to somebody,I because of everything that's going on, I tend to forget their names. So I do try tothink of that name when as soon as I'm told it and repeat it in my head, so I try not to forget it.\n",
      "That makes a lot of sense! Social gatherings can definitely be overwhelming, and it’s great that you have a strategy to help you remember names by repeating them in your head. Have you found any other techniques that work for you in those situations, or is it mostly about that mental repetition?\n",
      "--- mostly repetition\n",
      "-------------------\n",
      "Some people prefer to keep things in the same spot, while others leave them wherever they last used them. What approach works best for you, and why do you think that is?\n",
      "Normally put things back where they belong.But if when I'm using it, I get distracted or I have to go tend to something,then I will justput it down somewherego do what I wasasked to do. And then when I come back to thethe item, I can't remember where I placed it, and I have to look everywhere for it.\n",
      "It sounds like you have a solid system for keeping things organized, but distractions can definitely throw a wrench in that! When you find yourself searching for something you misplaced, how do you usually feel about it? Does it lead to frustration, or do you have any strategies to help stay calm while you look for it?\n",
      "I would learn that if Istand still and move my eyes from side to side,more often than not, I remember where I put it.\n",
      "That's an interesting technique! It sounds like it really helps you tap into your memory. What made you discover that standing still and moving your eyes helped? Have you found other methods that work for you when it comes to remembering where you put things?\n",
      "I've saw it on QI.And it's just something I've done ever since, butsometimes I try and retrace my steps.\n",
      "That's a clever way to use what you've learned from QI! Retracing your steps also seems like a practical approach. When you do that, do you find it helps jog your memory more often? Or is it more about calming your mind while you think?\n",
      "--- both\n",
      "-------------------\n",
      "When it comes to remembering what you need at the store, do you have a go-to trick or routine? Or do you just wing it and hope for the best?\n",
      "I always write lists to try and follow that.\n",
      "That's a great strategy! Writing lists can really help keep things organized. I'm curious, do you have a specific method for creating your lists? Like do you categorize items or just jot them down as they come to mind?\n",
      "I imagine the shop that I'm going to in my head.And I start writing from walking through the door whataisle I'll be in, what items I'll need from that aisle, and then the next aisle, and then all the way to the till.\n",
      "That’s such a creative approach! Visualizing the store layout like that must make it easier to remember everything you need. How do you find that method works for you? Do you feel it helps you avoid forgetting anything, or do you still have the occasional slip-up?\n",
      "--- It works really well and I rarely forget an item\n",
      "-------------------\n",
      "Are there any specific switches or locks that you forget about, or does it happen in general. Do you have any little routines or reminders to help you?\n",
      "It just happens in general.Normally, it's the front door.I don't have any routines.\n",
      "Got it! It sounds like the front door is the main thing that slips your mind sometimes. Since you don’t have any routines in place, have you thought about any strategies or reminders that might help you remember those little things? Or maybe there’s something you've tried in the past that worked for you?\n",
      "No. I haven't really\n",
      "That's totally okay! Sometimes, it can be tough to find what works best. If you ever feel like exploring some ideas or methods to help with those reminders, I'm here for it! But for now, how do you usually feel when you realize you've forgotten something like that?\n",
      "know we just laugh at myself and go back andmake sure I don't I I lock the door.\n",
      "That's a great way to handle it! Finding humor in those moments can really lighten the mood. Do you find that laughing at yourself helps you feel less stressed when things like that happen?\n",
      "--- Yes laughing at myself is something I do a lot\n",
      "-------------------\n",
      "Do you usually stick to a set routine to stay organized, or do you prefer taking things one step at a time?\n",
      "It really depends on the situation, but usually, I would havea routineand then it saves things piling up andbecoming a bigger job.\n",
      "That makes a lot of sense! Routines can definitely help keep things manageable. What kinds of routines do you find work best for you? Are there specific areas where you feel they make the biggest difference?\n",
      "If it's Haynesburg, it'slike, doing the little bit every day\n",
      "I get that! Breaking things down into small daily tasks can really lighten the load. Do you have any particular strategies or tools you use to help keep track of those daily tasks, or do you just rely on memory?\n",
      "Yes. I would normally make a to do list and work off that.Every day.\n",
      "That's a great approach! To-do lists can really help keep everything organized. Do you find that writing things down helps you remember tasks better, or is it more about having a visual reminder of what needs to be done?\n",
      "--- Yes writing things down really helps and reminds me what still needs to be done\n",
      "-------------------\n",
      "Can you name any situation that has allowed you to express yourself creatively and how?\n",
      "Yes. I'vecreated paintings and poems.\n",
      "That sounds wonderful! What inspires your paintings and poems? Do you find that certain themes or experiences come up often in your creative work?\n",
      "It can bea viewpoint that I've really liked orif it's a situation that I've been in where there's a lot of emotion.\n",
      "That's really interesting! Emotions can definitely add depth to creative expression. Can you share a specific painting or poem that was inspired by a particularly emotional experience? What was that experience like for you?\n",
      "I've been ininspired by doing a monologue and reaching thetop of the mountain and seeing the view.\n",
      "That's such a vivid and powerful experience! Climbing to the top of a mountain and seeing the view must have felt incredibly rewarding. How did that moment influence your monologue? Did it change the way you expressed your thoughts or feelings in your creative work?\n",
      "--- Yes as there was a journey. It wasn't easy reaching the top so had more depth to it.\n",
      "-------------------\n",
      "Being quiet or talkative can shape how we connect with others. Have you noticed how often you talk affects the interactions with people around you?\n",
      "Occasionally, yes. I have been told that I'm very quiet and reserved.But I tend to listen to people rather thanlike to talk about myself.\n",
      "That's really interesting! It sounds like you value the perspectives of others and enjoy being a good listener. How do you think your quietness and listening style impact your relationships or the way people perceive you?\n",
      "I think, occasionally,people always feel as if they need to take lead in conversations.And there can often be pregnant pausesof silence\n",
      "That makes sense! Those pauses can create a unique dynamic in conversations. Do you find that those moments of silence lead to deeper thoughts or reflections, or do they sometimes feel a bit awkward for you?\n",
      "Yes. They can be awkward.\n",
      "I appreciate you sharing your thoughts on that! It’s interesting how dynamics in conversation can really shape our interactions. Let’s keep moving forward!\n",
      "--- I tend to be rather guarded with my thoughts and opinions, and am a private person - not great if I am with a similar type of person!\n",

      "I implemented a newbiological database which helped tocontribute to the annual reports that the members receive every year.\n",
      "That’s impressive! It sounds like a meaningful contribution. What inspired you to create that biological database? And how have the members responded to it in terms of its usefulness for the annual reports?\n",
      "The previous databasewas very cumbersome.And old fashioned,I'm not even sure that the members are awareofmy contributionor that the there is a new database.\n",
      "It sounds like your update was definitely needed! It's understandable if members weren't immediately aware of the changes. Have you thought about ways to promote the new database to ensure everyone knows how to use it and benefit from it?\n",
